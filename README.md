## 5. Imagery

### 5.1 Photography Style

#### Suitable Subjects

- **Product Close-Ups**: Detailed shots of Polycrete products to showcase their quality and unique features.
- **Contextual Shots**: Polycrete products being used in real-world construction projects. This can help demonstrate their practical applications and effectiveness.
- **Architectural and Construction Images**: Photos of impressive buildings, structures, or construction sites where Polycrete products have been used.
- **People at Work**: Showcasing professionals using Polycrete products, emphasizing safety, efficiency, and craftsmanship. This helps to humanize the brand and showcases the people who use and benefit from Polycrete products.

#### Compositions

- **Bold and Direct**: Images should be clear, straightforward, and focused. The subject should be easily identifiable and the composition should guide the viewer's eye towards it.
- **Balanced**: While the subject of the photo should be clear, it's also important to have balance in the image. This can be achieved through the use of negative space, symmetry, or complementary elements within the photo.
- **Dynamic Angles**: Consider using interesting and unconventional perspectives to make the images more engaging. Overhead shots, low angle shots, or macro shots can add interest and depth to your photography.

#### Color Treatments

- **Authentic and Natural**: Colors in the images should be realistic and true to life. Over-saturation or excessive filtering should be avoided to maintain authenticity.
- **Consistent Palette**: While natural colors are preferred, the overall color palette should align with the brand's color scheme. This may mean favoring images that naturally incorporate your brand's colors, or subtly post-processing images to highlight those colors.
- **Contrast and Clarity**: Images should have good contrast and clarity to make them visually appealing and to ensure they reproduce well both online and in print. Shadows and highlights should be well balanced to ensure details are visible and the image is easy to read.

### 5.2 Iconography

- **Ionicons**: This is a beautifully crafted open source icon set, with iOS, Material Design, and Outline styles.

#### Style of Icons to Use

- **Simplicity**: Icons should be simple and not overly detailed. They should be easily recognizable at small sizes. For example, a hammer icon to represent construction or building, or a checkmark for completion or approval.
- **Consistency**: Icons should be stylistically consistent with each other. This includes consistent line weights, corner radiuses, and proportions. If one icon uses rounded corners, all should. 
- **Alignment with Brand**: The style of the icons should align with the overall brand aesthetic. If your branding is modern and minimalistic, your icons should be too. For a brand like Polycrete, you might use solid, bold icons with a modern feel.
- **Representative**: Each icon should clearly represent the concept or functionality it's meant to convey. A paintbrush could represent design services, or a gear could represent engineering or technical services.

Each icon corresponds to a particular concept or function. The home icon can be used to represent the home page or main menu, the mail icon can be used for the contact form or email address, and the cube icon could represent your products or services.

### 5.3 Infographics

#### Guidelines for Creating Data-driven Visuals

- **Clarity and Simplicity**: Infographics should present data in a clear and easy-to-understand manner. Avoid overly complex visuals that could confuse the viewer. For example, a bar graph or pie chart can often present data more clearly than a complex diagram.
- **Consistent Styling**: The design and color scheme of infographics should be consistent with the overall brand style. This includes using the brand's color palette, fonts, and general design aesthetic. For Polycrete, you might use colors that match your brand's logo and a clean, modern design style.
- **Data Accuracy**: Ensure the data is represented accurately. Misrepresentation can lead to loss of trust from your audience. For example, if you're presenting a percentage, make sure the segments of your pie chart accurately represent the percentages they're meant to depict.
- **Accessibility**: Use colors and patterns that are distinguishable for those with color-blindness. Also, provide alternative text descriptions for infographics for those using screen readers. For example, you might avoid using red and green in the same graphic, since these colors can be hard to distinguish for color-blind individuals.
